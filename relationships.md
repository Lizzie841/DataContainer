# Relationships

## Contents

Using the data container generator to manage objects and the properties can be a small win for you. It allows you to use memory in a way that is probably more cache and SIMD friendly, but it wouldn't be unreasonable to do everything that the generator does by hand. Relationships, however, are a different story. Allowing the data container generator to manage the relationships between the objects contained within it can save you a great deal of tedious and error-prone boilerplate. And, more importantly, it allows you to evolve your design without having to constantly update all of that boilerplate.

A relationship models a connection between two or more object instances that you want to track. From a programming perspective, every pointer or reference in a class or structure is (part of) a logical relationship. If you were migrating an existing collection of classes to be managed by a data container, each of those pointers or references would end up as part of a relationship, and the properties of the objects themselves would make no reference to other objects.

## Unique aspects of relationships

Relationships are, at least syntactically, a strict superset of objects, and anything that is found in an object definition can also be found in a relationship definition (i.e. inside `relationship{ ... }`). Most importantly, relationships can contain their own properties, which can be used to represent values that only make sense in the context of an interaction between two or more objects. You may wonder, then, why you would bother using objects at all, and the simple answer is that relationships can only be between objects; a relationship cannot relate to another relationship. Thus there must be objects in order for relationships to do anything at all.

For the remainder of this document we will be concerned exclusively with the features of relationships that objects don't have, and with the occasional ways in which the behavior of relationships deviates from that of objects.

### Links

Specifying the objects involved in a relationship is done by adding `link` keys to the relationship definition (and there must be at least one for the definition to be valid). Like the `property` key, a `link` key contains a number of sub-keys. The `object{ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶}` sub-key determines which type of object is connected by this particular link. While `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` must be an object defined somewhere else in the file, it does not have to be defined prior to defining the relationship. The `name{...}` sub-key determines how this link will be referred to in the context of the relationship. It must be a valid C++ identifier, but there are no other restrictions placed upon it. (However, for the sake of everyone's sanity, try to choose a name that is as descriptive as possible of the role that the linked object plays in the relationship.) The `type{...}` sub-key determines some of the constraints placed on the relationship (more on this in a moment). Its parameter must be one of `unique`, `many`, or `unindexed`. The `type` sub-key may also appear as `type{...}{optional}`. The first parameter is as before, and the second parameter must always be `optional` Finally, a fourth possible sub-key is `index_storage{...}`. This an optional sub-key, and is required only when `type` is set to `many`. Its parameter must be one of `list`, `array`, or `std_vector`, the meaning of which is discussed in [Storage of indexing data](#storage-of-indexing-data) below.

It was already mentioned in the [overview](overview.md) that relationship instances can be thought of as rows in a table. (e.g. the the table below of a relationship between two objects with a single property.)

| pet (animal id)    | owner (person id) | adopted on (some date type) |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1                  | 7                 | ...                         |
| 2                  | 3                 | ...                         |
| 5                  | 4                 | ...                         |
| 9                  | 3                 | ...                         |

A link of `type{unique}` means that the handle for the linked object may only appear once in the column for that link, while a link with `type{many}` may appear multiple times. And, leveraging those constraints, indexing data is stored for the linked instances that allows you to look up the relationship instances that they are involved in. An object that is linked as `type{unique}` will have functions added that allow finding from an instance of such an object the unique relationship instance (if any) that it is in, while an object that is linked as `type{many}` will have functions added to iterate over all of the relationship instances that an instance of that object is involved in. The data container is also able to use this indexing data to keep relationship instances up to date with changes in the objects. If they type of the link does not bear the second parameter `{optional}`, then deleting an object instance that is linked in this way will automatically delete the relationship as well. If the type of link is marked `{optional}`, then deleting the linked object instance will result in the handle referencing it in the relationship being set to the invalid state. Similarly, an object instance that is moved will have any relationship instances it is involved in updated to reflect its new location. And this helps to explain the purpose of `type{unindexed}`. As with `type{many}`, no constraints are placed on how many times the objects linked in this way may appear in a column. Additionally, no extra indexing data is stored at all. This has two effects. First, no functions will be created for looking up relationship instances from the object instances so linked. And secondly, the relationship instances will not be updated as the result of any changes to the object instances, and so invalid or incorrect handles may end up stored in such a link. A `type{unindexed}` link, then, is only advisable when you know that you need the performance advantages that it brings, and when you know that the objects being related will be neither created, nor deleted, nor moved for the lifetime of the relationship instance.[^1] Further suggestions for making the best used of `type{unindexed}` links are found in [Primary keys](#primary-keys) below.

### Storage of indexing data

For `type{unique}` links (except primary keys, see next section) the indexing data required is a simple handle back to the relationship instance that an object instance is involved in (if any), which is logically managed as part of the object. (Note: the management of this data is entirely invisible to the end user, this is simply a description of how it is implemented.) For `type{many}` links, however, the indexing data is more complicated; efficiency demands that each object instance maintain a list of the relationship instances it is involved in, and this list needs some kind of dynamic storage. I haven't been able to come up with a solution that is obviously best in all cases, so instead you can pick among three options for how these lists are to be stored on a case-by-case basis: `index_storage{array}`, `index_storage{std_vector}`, and `index_storage{list}`.

If you choose `array`, the lists of relationship instances will be stored as dynamically sized arrays backed by a fixed-size memory pool. Internally this is implemented in the same way that `vector_pool` type properties are, as described in (Objects and properties)[objects_and_properties.md#vector_pool]. The advantage of this approach is that the general memory allocator does not have to be called in order to manage the indexes. The disadvantages are twofold. First, the memory pool backing the lists is a fixed size, and it is possible to exhaust it. Currently the size of this pool is 16-times-the-maximum-number-of-relationship-instances bytes. Secondly, because the maximum number of relationship instances is used to estimate the size of the memory pool, it cannot be used in conjunction with relationships that are defined as `size{expandable}` (including those that are implicitly `size{expandable}` because of their primary key, as described below).

If you choose `std_vector`, the lists of relationship instances will each be stored in a `std::vector`. This is more flexible than arrays backed by a fixed-size memory pool, but it also incurs more overhead, both in storing each `std::vector` (24 bytes in many implementations), and in the performance costs incurred by using the general memory allocator to grow the underlying storage of these `std::vector`s.

Finally there is `list`, which is probably just a bad option .[^2] If you choose `list`, the lists of relationship instances will be stored in a doubly linked list that is managed logically as an intrusive list inside the relationship instances themselves. Theoretically, this has the same trade-offs as any linked list as compared to an array: it has better insertion and deletion performance at the cost of slower traversal times. But given that the individual lists of relationship instances will probably be small, I suspect that it doesn't actually provide better insertion and deletion performance.[^3] The one advantage it does provide, and the reason it is still available as an option, is that the implementation, like `array`, never calls the general memory allocator. But, unlike `array`, it can be used with relationships stored as `size{expandable}`, and its design guarantees that it will never run out of space (the storage space required to place each relationship instance in a list is logically allocated as part of the memory backing the potential relationship instance itself, so if you have enough room to store the relationship instances, you have enough room to store any configuration of the lists involving them).

### Primary keys

Primary keys are an aspect of relationships that the generator attempts to manage automatically, and to hide from the end user as much as possible. However, there are performance implications to primary keys, as well as some implications for behavior, so you probably still need to be aware of them.

Every relationship is automatically assigned a primary key, when possible, as a performance optimization. The primary key must be one of the `type{unique}` (and *not* `type{unique}{optional}`) links in the relationship; if there are no such links then no primary key can be assigned. When choosing a primary key automatically, object definitions that specify a fixed size are strictly preferred to `expandable` ones. Then, object definitions with `contiguous` storage type are chosen over those with `erasable` which are chosen over those with `compactable`. Finally, all other things being equal, the object definition that has the smallest defined size is preferred. If you don't like the way this automatic choice is made, or if you come to rely on any of the behavioral differences associated with the unique key and don't want your program to break if the definition of the objects or relationship changes, you can add `primary_key{ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶}` to the definition of a relationship, which will force the named `type{unique}` link to be used as the primary key.

If a relationship has a primary key, then instances of it are stored as a logical part of the object instances of the primary key type (you can think of this as the relationship as adding extra members to the class or struct definition for the type of the primary key). In particular, this means that the indexes used to access the relationship instances are logically identical to those that are used to access the object instances (although they still have distinct types). And so no actual storage space is allocated for relationship instances to store a handle to the object instance of its primary key link, nor do object instances of that type have storage allocated to store the handle of the relationships instance of this type (as both can be calculated directly from the handles themselves). This means that a relationship that has one link of type `unique` is more efficient than it would be if that link were turned into type `unindexed`, even though in general such links require less storage.

This also has implications for converting existing objects to be managed by a data container. It might seem natural to convert a pointer from type `object_a` to `object_b` such as:

```
class object_a {
	...
	public:
	object_b* member_pointer;
	...
};
```

to something like:

```
object{
	name{object_a}
	...
	property{
		name{member_pointer}
		type{object_b_id}
	}
	...
}
```

However, it is just as efficient (and will be essentially represented in the same way internally) to convert it to:

```
object{
	name{object_a}
	...
}

relationship{
	name{...}
	link{
		object{object_a}
		name{...}
		type{unique}
	}
	link{
		object{object_b}
		name{member_pointer}
		type{unindexed}
	}
}
```

This requires you to add some additional names describing the relationship from `object_a` to `object_b`, but you don't lose anything by making an explicit relationship in this way, and you gain the additional flexibility of being able to add indexing information later for `member_pointer` if you so choose.

Ideally, there would be no differences between the way the primary keys behave and the behavior of other links, but unfortunately some compromises have been made for the sake of performance. For every object linked with `unique` you can get a handle back to the relationship it is involved in with `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` (more details and slightly less verbose function names are described below). For a non primary, but `unique`, key this function may return a handle containing the invalid index value if no relationship has been created involving the object. Thus, you could cast this return value to bool to test whether such a relationship exists. On the other hand, if the object is linked as a primary key, `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` called with a valid object handle will never return an invalid index. To test whether the returned value represents an existing relationship, the best you can do is check it with `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_is_valid(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)`. For a relationship with a primary key, that function returns true if at least one link other than the primary key contains a potentially valid object handle. NOTE: this means that if you create a relationship with a single `unique` primary key and with the remainder of the links marked with `optional` then the data container may not be able to tell the difference between a non-existent relationship and one which has simply had all of its other links intentionally set to invalid handles.

Finally, if a relationship has a primary key, any `size` or `storage_type` keys in its description will be ignored. It will be given a `size` to match that of the primary key, and its storage type will function as `contiguous`, except that its current size will be adjusted to match that of the primary key. For relationships without a primary key, `size` and `storage_type` function as they do with objects, except that storage types of `contiguous` are not allowed (as it must always be possible to delete an arbitrary relationship).

### Composite keys

The first thing to note is that using one or more composite keys brings in an additional dependency, namely [this hash map](https://github.com/martinus/unordered_dense). A copy of the single header file necessary to use it is in CommonIncludes, but you can (and probably should) grab a copy of the most up-to-date version yourself.

Composite keys are added to a relationship by adding `composite_key{...}` as an additional key inside the relationship definition. `composite_key` expects a single parameter that will be parsed as a sequence of sub-keys. Like a link or a property, each `composite_key` must contain a `name{...}` sub-key that contains in its single parameter a valid C++ identifier. Each composite key must also include two or more `index{ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶}` sub-keys, where each link name is a link previously defined for the relationship.

Defining a composite key does two things. First, it allows you to find an instance of the relationship based on the combination of indexes in the composite key. Specifically, the data container will provide the function `get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_by_ùò§ùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∞ùò¥ùò™ùòµùò¶ ùò¨ùò¶ùò∫ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(...)` taking as parameters a handle for each of the links involved in the composite key. For example, a composite key defined as

```
composite_key{
	name{owner_pet_key}
	index{owner}
	index{owned_pet}
}
```

would generate the function `get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_by_owner_pet_key(person_id owner_p, pet_id owned_pet_p)` This function returns a handle to the relationship instance between handles that matches exactly those passed as parameters, or an invalid handle if there is no such relationship instance. Secondly, it forces each relationship instance to contain a unique combination of the linked objects involved in the composite key.

Multiple composite keys may be defined for the same relationship. If they are, the uniqueness requirement will be enforced for each composite key independently of the others. For example if the first composite key is between links `A`, `B`, and `C` and the second composite key is between links `B`, `C`, and `D`, then each relationship instance will required to have both an A-B-C combination that is unique to it and a B-C-D combination that is unique to it.

### `multiple` links

The links discussed so far each connect the relationship to a single object instance. You can change this by adding `multiple{...}` or `multiple{...}{distinct}` to the definition of a link, with a number as its first parameter. Such a link will connect the relationship to the specified number of object instances rather than just one.

There are a number of consequences of this change. First, a link marked as `multiple` is not eligible to be a primary key. Second, there are changes to the getters and setters generated for this link (see [below](#those-in-the-relationship)). Third, the object instances that are linked in this way are not ordered, conceptually. Although you can access the n<sup>th</sup> object instance linked in a `multiple` link, it is not wise to depend on the relative position being stable over any operation that changes the relationship. When involved in a composite key, a `multiple` link will internally be sorted so that different orderings of the same combination of object instances find the same relationship through the composite key.

`multiple` links have two common uses. First let us consider a relationship of biological parentage. You could link every child to their biological parents as so:

```
relationship {
	name{parentage}
	link{
		object{person}
		name{child}
		type{unique}
	}
	link{
		object{person}
		name{bio_mother}
		type{many}
		index_storage{array}
	}
	link{
		object{person}
		name{bio_father}
		type{many}
		index_storage{array}
	}
}
```

The problem with this is that finding all the biological children of some parent will require two lookups: first you would have to find all their children as a mother and then all their children as a father. For most purposes this will be both cumbersome and unnecessary. With a `multiple` link, this relationship could be expressed as follows:

```
relationship {
	name{parentage}
	link{
		object{person}
		name{child}
		type{unique}
	}
	link{
		object{person}
		name{bio_parent}
		type{many}
		index_storage{array}
		multiple{2}{distinct}
	}
}
```

Adding `distinct` requires that both of the parents linked be distinct `person`s. And defining the relationship in this way will create a single index linking each person to all of their biological children, meaning that you only need to iterate over that single list to enumerate them all.

The second common use of a `multiple` link is to represent an edge in an undirected graph. Consider the following relationship:

```
relationship {
	name{edge}
	...
	
	link{
		object{node}
		name{start}
		type{many}
		index_storage{array}
	}
	link{
		object{node}
		name{end}
		type{many}
		index_storage{array}
	}
	
	composite_key{
		name{edge_identifier}
		index{start}
		index{end}
	}
}
```

This relationship represents an edge in a directed graph. Not only do you find and iterate over the notes connected as the start and end of an edge distinctly, but edges from A to B are treated as distinct from edges from B to A as far as the composite key is concerned.

To make an undirected graph edge we can use the following:

```
relationship {
	name{edge}
	...
	
	link{
		object{node}
		name{connected_node}
		type{many}
		index_storage{array}
		multiple{2}
	}
	
	composite_key{
		name{edge_identifier}
		index{connected_node}
	}
}
```

Now there are is no difference between the node that starts the edge and the node that ends the edge. More importantly, the composite key will treat an edge from A to B as identical to an edge from B to A.

### Try create and force create

Unlike objects, there are two ways to create a new relationship instance: `try_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(...)` and `force_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(...)`. Both take as parameters one handle for each link in the relationship. `try_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` first checks whether the new relationship can be created without violating any of the relationship constraints (i.e. it checks whether any of the object instances involved in a `unique` link are already involved in some other relationship, whether any of the composite keys that would be created already index another relationship, and checks whether any of the parameters for non `optional` links are invalid handles). If the new relationship would violate any of those constraints, `try_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` returns an invalid handle. Otherwise, it will create the new relationship instance as specified and return a handle to it.

`force_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶`, like `try_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶`, checks whether the new relationship would violate any of the relationship constraints. Unlike `try_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶`, it will call `delete_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` to remove any existing relationship instances that would conflict with the new relationship instance, and will even set non `optional` links to the invalid handle value if it is passed to the function. `force_create_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` then creates the new relationship instance as specified and returns a handle to it.

### Deleting relationships

A relationship instance can be deleted in the same way that an object instance can with `delete_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` Additionally, if any of the object instances linked by a relationship instance with type `unique` or `many` links that are not marked as `optional` are deleted, then the relationship instance will automatically be deleted as well.

### Getters and setters

If a relationship has any properties, it will have the standard getters and setters for them. Additionally, relationships generate the following getters and setters:

#### Those in the relationship

For every link in a relationship definition, a getter will be created to access the handle stored in that link as `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` (as well as the SIMD vectorization friendly versions). For `type{many}` and `type{unindexed}` links *not* involved in a composite key, a setter for those links as `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_set_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id)` will also be generated. For links *two* setters will be generated: `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_set_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id)` and `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_try_set_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id)`. This is because changing the value of such a link may violate the relationship constraints if the new value you wish to set it to is already involved in some other relationship instance, if it would result in the relationship mapping to a composite key that is already taken, or if it is not marked as `optional` and you are passing an invalid handle. The `set` version of the setter resolves this by calling `delete_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` on any conflicting relationship instance (and deleting the relationship itself if you pass an invalid handle value for a non `optional` link), while the `try_set` version will change the value only if it can be done without violating the relationship constraints, and will return `true` if the link could be set and `false` otherwise.

For `multiple` links, there are some modifications to these getters and setters. First, the standard getter and setters appear as `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, int32_t)`, `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_set_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, int32_t, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id)` and `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_try_set_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, int32_t, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id)`. The integer parameter for these functions determines the (zero-based) index of the internal copy of the link you want to get or set. Because these indexes are not necessarily stable over operations that modify the relationship, they are not the preferred way to interact with `multiple` links. Thus, the data container additionally provides `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_has_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id)`, which returns `true` if and only if any of the internal links is to the passed handle; `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_replace_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id new_value, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id old_value)`, which calls `set` to replace the linked object instance referenced by `old_value` with that of `new_value` (or does nothing if `old_value` is not present); and `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_try_replace_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id new_value, ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶_id old_value)`, which functions the same as `replace`, except that instead of calling `set` internally, it calls `try_set` and returns the result of that function. Finally, there are no SIMD friendly versions of the getters for `multiple` links.

#### Those added to the related objects

A relationship also generates additional getter and setters that are a logical part of the objects linked to the relationship (and in their fat handles, if you are using the nice syntax). If the object is linked as `unique`, an `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` that returns the relationship instance it is linked to (or an invalid handle if there is no such relationship), along with SIMD vectorization friendly versions, will be generated. In addition, an `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_remove_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` function will be generated. If the link is not `optional`, this function will delete the relationship instance the object instance is linked to, if any. If the link is `optional`, it will set to the invalid handle the stored link to the passed object in the relationship instance that the object is linked to, if any (thus removing the object instance from the relationship, while letting the relationship continue to exist).

If the object is linked as `many`, a different collection of getters and setters will be generated for it. First there is `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)`, which returns an object that provides `begin()` and `end()`, allowing you to write loops such as `for(auto i : ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)) { ... }`, where `i` will be a fat handle that iterates over the relationship instances in which `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id` is linked as ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶. In addition to this, there is also `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_for_each_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, T&& functor)` which will call the provided function once for each relationship instance that the object instance is linked to. This function will be called with the handle of each such relationship as its parameter if the function is called from the data container itself, or a fat handle if it is called from a fat handle using the nice syntax. If the index storage is either `array` or `std_vector`, a `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_range of_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)`, which returns a `std::pair` of `ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id const*` that span the underlying array containing the relationship handles linked to the object instance. Finally, an `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_remove_all_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` function will be generated. If the link is not `optional`, this function will delete all of the relationship instances that the object instance is linked to. If the link is `optional` this function will instead set the link to the object instance to the invalid handle in all the relationship instances it was linked to (without deleting those relationships).

Note that the names of these function can be quite verbose, in part because of the `_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` suffix. This suffix must exist to cover the possibility that the same type of object is linked into a relationship via two or more different links. If the object is not linked into a relationship via multiple different links, convenience versions of all the functions described in this section without the `_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` suffix will also be generated.

#### Implicit joins

Finally, there is a small collection of functions that can save you the trouble of writing things like `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùò©ùò¢ùòØùò•ùò≠ùò¶_id.get_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶().get_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶/ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶()` (not to mention the terrifyingly more verbose syntax for the ugly version). (Note: for the remainder of this section "property" also includes the links to individual object instances contained in a relation.) However, this collection is small because there are some limitations. First, there is the question of what happens when the object instance is not involved in any relationship instance. For properties involving simple types the easy answer is just to return a default constructed value (so zero for the numerical types and an invalid handle for handles). For larger types and objects, however, you really want a reference to the stored value, and not a copy. Thus the natural return type would be a `std::optional` wrapping a reference. But the standard library doesn't provide that type, and it isn't fair to require boost, so the best we could do would be to return a possibly-null pointer. And since that is inconsistent with the rest of the syntax, the functions simply aren't generated for now. Secondly, these function are only generated when the corresponding `_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` suffix can be dropped from the getter that they are hiding. This is simply because the point of generating these functions is to provide shorter, more convenient access, and adding additional `_as_ùò≠ùò™ùòØùò¨ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶` qualifiers rather defeats the purpose.

An additional pitfall of leaning on these functions is that they require repeatedly looking up the relationship instance that the object is involved in. It is more efficient to get the relationship instance once and then access properties through it if you need to access more than a single property.

With all that said, here are the generated functions themselves: For an object linked as `unique`, `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_get_ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_from_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id)` and `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_set_ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_from_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶)` functions will be generated  for every property in the relationship. For an object linked as `many`, the functions `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_for_each_ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_from_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, T&& functor)` and `ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_has_ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_from_ùò≥ùò¶ùò≠ùò¢ùòµùò™ùò∞ùòØùò¥ùò©ùò™ùò± ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶(ùò∞ùò£ùò´ùò¶ùò§ùòµ ùòØùò¢ùòÆùò¶_id, ùò±ùò≥ùò∞ùò±ùò¶ùò≥ùòµùò∫ ùòµùò∫ùò±ùò¶)` will be generated for every property in the relationship. The first calls the provided function once for each relationship instance that the object instance is linked to, with the value stored for the specified property in those relationship instances passed to the function. The second returns `true` if any of the relationship instances linked to the object instance contain a value stored in the specified property that compares as equal to the value passed as the second parameter, and `false` otherwise.

[^1]: You can also work around some of these limitations with `hook{delete}` and `hook{move}`, but be sure to measure to make sure that this solution is actually better than `type{unique}` or `type{many}`.
